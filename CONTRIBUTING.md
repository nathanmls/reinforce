## üè´ Self-Hosting and Local Alternatives (Post-MVP)

A core priority for Reinforce is to enable complete self-hosting capabilities for educational institutions. The following initiatives will be implemented after the MVP to reduce external dependencies and enhance self-hosting options:

1. **Local TTS Alternatives**
   - Replace ElevenLabs with open-source TTS solutions
     - Integrate Mozilla TTS or other open-source voice synthesis engines
     - Add support for local voice models that can run on school servers
     - Develop a fallback system that gracefully degrades to simpler TTS when resources are limited
   - Create a modular TTS adapter system to easily switch between providers
   - Optimize voice synthesis for low-latency on modest hardware

2. **Local Database Alternatives**
   - Replace Firebase with self-hostable database solutions
     - Implement PostgreSQL or MongoDB adapters for data storage
     - Create migration tools to transfer data from Firebase to local databases
     - Develop a consistent API layer that works with both Firebase and local alternatives
   - Add documentation for database setup and maintenance for school IT administrators
   - Ensure data integrity and backup solutions for self-hosted deployments

3. **Containerization and Deployment**
   - Create Docker containers for easy deployment
     - Develop a comprehensive docker-compose setup for one-command deployment
     - Optimize container images for minimal resource usage
   - Provide Kubernetes configurations for larger deployments
   - Add detailed deployment guides for various hosting environments

4. **Authentication Alternatives**
   - Implement local authentication options to replace Firebase Auth
     - Add support for LDAP/Active Directory integration for schools
     - Create OAuth connectors for existing school identity providers
     - Develop a standalone authentication system for completely offline deployments

5. **Offline Capabilities**
   - Enhance Progressive Web App features for limited connectivity environments
   - Implement local AI model inference where possible
   - Create sync mechanisms for intermittent connectivity scenarios

6. **Resource Optimization**
   - Develop tiered deployment options based on available resources
   - Create asset optimization tools for schools with limited bandwidth
   - Implement performance monitoring and auto-scaling capabilities

**Implementation Priorities:**
1. First establish a stable adapter/provider pattern for all external services
2. Focus on TTS and database alternatives as the highest priorities
3. Create comprehensive documentation for self-hosting scenarios
4. Develop and test in resource-constrained environments to ensure viability

These initiatives align with our commitment to making Reinforce as open-source and self-hostable as possible, ensuring schools have complete control over their data and implementation.

5. **Character Model and Animation Enhancements**

1. **Ready Player Me Character Integration**
   - Replace existing AI-generated characters with Ready Player Me (RPM) compatible models
   - Develop a seamless character creation and customization workflow
   - Ensure cross-platform compatibility for RPM characters

2. **Custom 3D Character Design**
   - Create cartoon-style 3D character models
     - Design multiple character archetypes (student, teacher, mentor)
     - Develop a consistent art style that appeals to the target age group
   - Ensure full compatibility with Ready Player Me rigging and animation standards
   - Implement modular character customization options
     - Adjustable body types
     - Diverse clothing and accessory options
     - Skin tone and feature variations
